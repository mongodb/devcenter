We spend time discussing the different approaches of the panelists, how they got started and how to engage and build an audience. We cover podcasting tech (and we live demo a glitch we had!) and equipment (Mike get's some plugs in!), and we try to examine the benefits and return on investment (qualitative and quantitive) that a Podcast will bring to your organisation. </p><p><br></p><p>So, if you're starting out on your podcasting journey, or even just thinking of it, then we hope this conversation and the advice imparted will help you understand the value of podcasting in either building and maintaining a brand, or growing a community, or both! </p>",

They speak about the main reasons to use serverless and why you should use serverless technologies for your development. Topics covered include Docker, Containers, Jib (for building Java Docker images), environment variables, development vs production environments, how to connect to MongoDB, security, and when to consider developing for serverless (hint - when there's significant need for scaling, reducing maintenance and freeing up developers!!) </p><p><br></p><p>Tune in to listen to what Abi and Mira have to share.</p>",

Initially they stood up their own on-prem MongoDB database to learn more, but then soon realised that moving to Atlas was key, particularly as they could host on Azure.</p><p><br></p><p>For Global Logic's client, Catalina, Jan manages everything from small clusters with a few hundred records all the way up to a system of 7 clusters with over 5Billion data records!So he know’s all about scaling - and teaches us some lessons he’s learnt along the way. He illustrates that if you only scale one large cluster (e.g with Autoscaling on), your database never gets a break! However, if you have smaller clusters, all autoscaling, along with predictable traffic patterns visualised by using Atlas metrics UI and performance advisor, you can analyse usage and re-organise structure appropriately.</p><p><br></p><p>Ultimately, understanding the workloads in your application and dividing those across clusters all working together is key to application performance.</p><p><br></p><p>Ján Srniček - https://www.linkedin.com/in/j%C3%A1n-srni%C4%8Dek-4a3b826b</p><p>Global Logic - https://www.globallogic.com/</p><p>Catalina - https://www.catalina.com/ </p><p>MongoDB - https://www.mongodb.com/ </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

We spend time discussing the different approaches of the panelists, how they got started and how to engage and build an audience. We cover podcasting tech (and we live demo a glitch we had!) and equipment (Mike get's some plugs in!), and we try to examine the benefits and return on investment (qualitative and quantitive) that a Podcast will bring to your organisation. </p><p><br></p><p>So, if you're starting out on your podcasting journey, or even just thinking of it, then we hope this conversation and the advice imparted will help you understand the value of podcasting in either building and maintaining a brand, or growing a community, or both! </p>",

They speak about the main reasons to use serverless and why you should use serverless technologies for your development. Topics covered include Docker, Containers, Jib (for building Java Docker images), environment variables, development vs production environments, how to connect to MongoDB, security, and when to consider developing for serverless (hint - when there's significant need for scaling, reducing maintenance and freeing up developers!!) </p><p><br></p><p>Tune in to listen to what Abi and Mira have to share.</p>",

Initially they stood up their own on-prem MongoDB database to learn more, but then soon realised that moving to Atlas was key, particularly as they could host on Azure.</p><p><br></p><p>For Global Logic's client, Catalina, Jan manages everything from small clusters with a few hundred records all the way up to a system of 7 clusters with over 5Billion data records!So he know’s all about scaling - and teaches us some lessons he’s learnt along the way. He illustrates that if you only scale one large cluster (e.g with Autoscaling on), your database never gets a break! However, if you have smaller clusters, all autoscaling, along with predictable traffic patterns visualised by using Atlas metrics UI and performance advisor, you can analyse usage and re-organise structure appropriately.</p><p><br></p><p>Ultimately, understanding the workloads in your application and dividing those across clusters all working together is key to application performance.</p><p><br></p><p>Ján Srniček - https://www.linkedin.com/in/j%C3%A1n-srni%C4%8Dek-4a3b826b</p><p>Global Logic - https://www.globallogic.com/</p><p>Catalina - https://www.catalina.com/ </p><p>MongoDB - https://www.mongodb.com/ </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

We spend time discussing the different approaches of the panelists, how they got started and how to engage and build an audience. We cover podcasting tech (and we live demo a glitch we had!) and equipment (Mike get's some plugs in!), and we try to examine the benefits and return on investment (qualitative and quantitive) that a Podcast will bring to your organisation. </p><p><br></p><p>So, if you're starting out on your podcasting journey, or even just thinking of it, then we hope this conversation and the advice imparted will help you understand the value of podcasting in either building and maintaining a brand, or growing a community, or both! </p>",

They speak about the main reasons to use serverless and why you should use serverless technologies for your development. Topics covered include Docker, Containers, Jib (for building Java Docker images), environment variables, development vs production environments, how to connect to MongoDB, security, and when to consider developing for serverless (hint - when there's significant need for scaling, reducing maintenance and freeing up developers!!) </p><p><br></p><p>Tune in to listen to what Abi and Mira have to share.</p>",

Initially they stood up their own on-prem MongoDB database to learn more, but then soon realised that moving to Atlas was key, particularly as they could host on Azure.</p><p><br></p><p>For Global Logic's client, Catalina, Jan manages everything from small clusters with a few hundred records all the way up to a system of 7 clusters with over 5Billion data records!So he know’s all about scaling - and teaches us some lessons he’s learnt along the way. He illustrates that if you only scale one large cluster (e.g with Autoscaling on), your database never gets a break! However, if you have smaller clusters, all autoscaling, along with predictable traffic patterns visualised by using Atlas metrics UI and performance advisor, you can analyse usage and re-organise structure appropriately.</p><p><br></p><p>Ultimately, understanding the workloads in your application and dividing those across clusters all working together is key to application performance.</p><p><br></p><p>Ján Srniček - https://www.linkedin.com/in/j%C3%A1n-srni%C4%8Dek-4a3b826b</p><p>Global Logic - https://www.globallogic.com/</p><p>Catalina - https://www.catalina.com/ </p><p>MongoDB - https://www.mongodb.com/ </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

We spend time discussing the different approaches of the panelists, how they got started and how to engage and build an audience. We cover podcasting tech (and we live demo a glitch we had!) and equipment (Mike get's some plugs in!), and we try to examine the benefits and return on investment (qualitative and quantitive) that a Podcast will bring to your organisation. </p><p><br></p><p>So, if you're starting out on your podcasting journey, or even just thinking of it, then we hope this conversation and the advice imparted will help you understand the value of podcasting in either building and maintaining a brand, or growing a community, or both! </p>",

They speak about the main reasons to use serverless and why you should use serverless technologies for your development. Topics covered include Docker, Containers, Jib (for building Java Docker images), environment variables, development vs production environments, how to connect to MongoDB, security, and when to consider developing for serverless (hint - when there's significant need for scaling, reducing maintenance and freeing up developers!!) </p><p><br></p><p>Tune in to listen to what Abi and Mira have to share.</p>",

Initially they stood up their own on-prem MongoDB database to learn more, but then soon realised that moving to Atlas was key, particularly as they could host on Azure.</p><p><br></p><p>For Global Logic's client, Catalina, Jan manages everything from small clusters with a few hundred records all the way up to a system of 7 clusters with over 5Billion data records!So he know’s all about scaling - and teaches us some lessons he’s learnt along the way. He illustrates that if you only scale one large cluster (e.g with Autoscaling on), your database never gets a break! However, if you have smaller clusters, all autoscaling, along with predictable traffic patterns visualised by using Atlas metrics UI and performance advisor, you can analyse usage and re-organise structure appropriately.</p><p><br></p><p>Ultimately, understanding the workloads in your application and dividing those across clusters all working together is key to application performance.</p><p><br></p><p>Ján Srniček - https://www.linkedin.com/in/j%C3%A1n-srni%C4%8Dek-4a3b826b</p><p>Global Logic - https://www.globallogic.com/</p><p>Catalina - https://www.catalina.com/ </p><p>MongoDB - https://www.mongodb.com/ </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

We spend time discussing the different approaches of the panelists, how they got started and how to engage and build an audience. We cover podcasting tech (and we live demo a glitch we had!) and equipment (Mike get's some plugs in!), and we try to examine the benefits and return on investment (qualitative and quantitive) that a Podcast will bring to your organisation. </p><p><br></p><p>So, if you're starting out on your podcasting journey, or even just thinking of it, then we hope this conversation and the advice imparted will help you understand the value of podcasting in either building and maintaining a brand, or growing a community, or both! </p>",

They speak about the main reasons to use serverless and why you should use serverless technologies for your development. Topics covered include Docker, Containers, Jib (for building Java Docker images), environment variables, development vs production environments, how to connect to MongoDB, security, and when to consider developing for serverless (hint - when there's significant need for scaling, reducing maintenance and freeing up developers!!) </p><p><br></p><p>Tune in to listen to what Abi and Mira have to share.</p>",

Initially they stood up their own on-prem MongoDB database to learn more, but then soon realised that moving to Atlas was key, particularly as they could host on Azure.</p><p><br></p><p>For Global Logic's client, Catalina, Jan manages everything from small clusters with a few hundred records all the way up to a system of 7 clusters with over 5Billion data records!So he know’s all about scaling - and teaches us some lessons he’s learnt along the way. He illustrates that if you only scale one large cluster (e.g with Autoscaling on), your database never gets a break! However, if you have smaller clusters, all autoscaling, along with predictable traffic patterns visualised by using Atlas metrics UI and performance advisor, you can analyse usage and re-organise structure appropriately.</p><p><br></p><p>Ultimately, understanding the workloads in your application and dividing those across clusters all working together is key to application performance.</p><p><br></p><p>Ján Srniček - https://www.linkedin.com/in/j%C3%A1n-srni%C4%8Dek-4a3b826b</p><p>Global Logic - https://www.globallogic.com/</p><p>Catalina - https://www.catalina.com/ </p><p>MongoDB - https://www.mongodb.com/ </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

We spend time discussing the different approaches of the panelists, how they got started and how to engage and build an audience. We cover podcasting tech (and we live demo a glitch we had!) and equipment (Mike get's some plugs in!), and we try to examine the benefits and return on investment (qualitative and quantitive) that a Podcast will bring to your organisation. </p><p><br></p><p>So, if you're starting out on your podcasting journey, or even just thinking of it, then we hope this conversation and the advice imparted will help you understand the value of podcasting in either building and maintaining a brand, or growing a community, or both! </p>",

They speak about the main reasons to use serverless and why you should use serverless technologies for your development. Topics covered include Docker, Containers, Jib (for building Java Docker images), environment variables, development vs production environments, how to connect to MongoDB, security, and when to consider developing for serverless (hint - when there's significant need for scaling, reducing maintenance and freeing up developers!!) </p><p><br></p><p>Tune in to listen to what Abi and Mira have to share.</p>",

Initially they stood up their own on-prem MongoDB database to learn more, but then soon realised that moving to Atlas was key, particularly as they could host on Azure.</p><p><br></p><p>For Global Logic's client, Catalina, Jan manages everything from small clusters with a few hundred records all the way up to a system of 7 clusters with over 5Billion data records!So he know’s all about scaling - and teaches us some lessons he’s learnt along the way. He illustrates that if you only scale one large cluster (e.g with Autoscaling on), your database never gets a break! However, if you have smaller clusters, all autoscaling, along with predictable traffic patterns visualised by using Atlas metrics UI and performance advisor, you can analyse usage and re-organise structure appropriately.</p><p><br></p><p>Ultimately, understanding the workloads in your application and dividing those across clusters all working together is key to application performance.</p><p><br></p><p>Ján Srniček - https://www.linkedin.com/in/j%C3%A1n-srni%C4%8Dek-4a3b826b</p><p>Global Logic - https://www.globallogic.com/</p><p>Catalina - https://www.catalina.com/ </p><p>MongoDB - https://www.mongodb.com/ </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

We spend time discussing the different approaches of the panelists, how they got started and how to engage and build an audience. We cover podcasting tech (and we live demo a glitch we had!) and equipment (Mike get's some plugs in!), and we try to examine the benefits and return on investment (qualitative and quantitive) that a Podcast will bring to your organisation. </p><p><br></p><p>So, if you're starting out on your podcasting journey, or even just thinking of it, then we hope this conversation and the advice imparted will help you understand the value of podcasting in either building and maintaining a brand, or growing a community, or both! </p>",

They speak about the main reasons to use serverless and why you should use serverless technologies for your development. Topics covered include Docker, Containers, Jib (for building Java Docker images), environment variables, development vs production environments, how to connect to MongoDB, security, and when to consider developing for serverless (hint - when there's significant need for scaling, reducing maintenance and freeing up developers!!) </p><p><br></p><p>Tune in to listen to what Abi and Mira have to share.</p>",

Initially they stood up their own on-prem MongoDB database to learn more, but then soon realised that moving to Atlas was key, particularly as they could host on Azure.</p><p><br></p><p>For Global Logic's client, Catalina, Jan manages everything from small clusters with a few hundred records all the way up to a system of 7 clusters with over 5Billion data records!So he know’s all about scaling - and teaches us some lessons he’s learnt along the way. He illustrates that if you only scale one large cluster (e.g with Autoscaling on), your database never gets a break! However, if you have smaller clusters, all autoscaling, along with predictable traffic patterns visualised by using Atlas metrics UI and performance advisor, you can analyse usage and re-organise structure appropriately.</p><p><br></p><p>Ultimately, understanding the workloads in your application and dividing those across clusters all working together is key to application performance.</p><p><br></p><p>Ján Srniček - https://www.linkedin.com/in/j%C3%A1n-srni%C4%8Dek-4a3b826b</p><p>Global Logic - https://www.globallogic.com/</p><p>Catalina - https://www.catalina.com/ </p><p>MongoDB - https://www.mongodb.com/ </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

We spend time discussing the different approaches of the panelists, how they got started and how to engage and build an audience. We cover podcasting tech (and we live demo a glitch we had!) and equipment (Mike get's some plugs in!), and we try to examine the benefits and return on investment (qualitative and quantitive) that a Podcast will bring to your organisation. </p><p><br></p><p>So, if you're starting out on your podcasting journey, or even just thinking of it, then we hope this conversation and the advice imparted will help you understand the value of podcasting in either building and maintaining a brand, or growing a community, or both! </p>",

They speak about the main reasons to use serverless and why you should use serverless technologies for your development. Topics covered include Docker, Containers, Jib (for building Java Docker images), environment variables, development vs production environments, how to connect to MongoDB, security, and when to consider developing for serverless (hint - when there's significant need for scaling, reducing maintenance and freeing up developers!!) </p><p><br></p><p>Tune in to listen to what Abi and Mira have to share.</p>",

Initially they stood up their own on-prem MongoDB database to learn more, but then soon realised that moving to Atlas was key, particularly as they could host on Azure.</p><p><br></p><p>For Global Logic's client, Catalina, Jan manages everything from small clusters with a few hundred records all the way up to a system of 7 clusters with over 5Billion data records!So he know’s all about scaling - and teaches us some lessons he’s learnt along the way. He illustrates that if you only scale one large cluster (e.g with Autoscaling on), your database never gets a break! However, if you have smaller clusters, all autoscaling, along with predictable traffic patterns visualised by using Atlas metrics UI and performance advisor, you can analyse usage and re-organise structure appropriately.</p><p><br></p><p>Ultimately, understanding the workloads in your application and dividing those across clusters all working together is key to application performance.</p><p><br></p><p>Ján Srniček - https://www.linkedin.com/in/j%C3%A1n-srni%C4%8Dek-4a3b826b</p><p>Global Logic - https://www.globallogic.com/</p><p>Catalina - https://www.catalina.com/ </p><p>MongoDB - https://www.mongodb.com/ </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
