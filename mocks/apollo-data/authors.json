So here we go, my name is Jay and I love helping people get the most out of their cloud environment. I've been a part of the IT industry since about 2001 when I got my first root user access at a tiny consulting firm as a System Administrator. This lead me on a long career that found me working in some really cool places like BuzzFeed, DigitalOcean and MongoDB. After spending most of my career in \"oncall\" situations, like when BuzzFeed had it's viral moment including a dress which no one could tell the color of, it was time for a new challenge. I moved on to MongoDB's Developer Advocacy team which taught me much about how to best enable the members of my community. I joined Microsoft for one major reason, so I can reach the biggest audiences possible to let them know why they should choose Azure as the right platform to ensure the best possible experience with their applications.",
