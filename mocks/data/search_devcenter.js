It is an incredible distributed query engine that enables seamless querying, transforming, and data migration across various sources inside and outside of Atlas! \n\nWith Atlas Data Federation, we can achieve a wide range of use cases, such as gaining a comprehensive view of our data through querying across multiple Atlas clusters and importing data from AWS S3 buckets into Atlas clusters. By combining various clusters and buckets, we can gain deeper insights into the data we have at hand. \n\nIn this tutorial, we show you how to utilize Atlas Data Federation to merge JSON data stored in your MongoDB Atlas cluster with data in your AWS S3 bucket.

Traditionally, analytics were done in batches by a special-purpose data warehousing analytical tool. However, with app-driven analytics, the application provides real-time visibility into what is happening right now. MongoDB is uniquely positioned in this arena due to its powerful query language and distributed architecture. MongoDB's distributed architecture allows users to dedicate certain nodes to analytics and other nodes to operational queries. MongoDB's Atlas platform also allows users to easily add dedicated analytical nodes, which can be configured separately from the nodes that handle operational queries. This is beneficial from a cost perspective because users can choose to allocate resources as needed for different types of queries.</p>","date":"2023-03-06T20:00:19.105Z","type":"Podcast","tags":[{"name":"*Podcast","type":"ContentType","slug":"/podcasts"}],"rating_metrics":{"average":null,"median":null,"count":0},"score":{},"slug":"/podcasts/ep-154-launching-your-app-to-the-next-level-with-in-app-analytics-and-mongodb"},{"authors":[],"name":"*Getting Started with Azure Functions and MongoDB Atlas using .NET and C#","image":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jr1BNuw_ZqQ/sddefault.jpg"},"description":"✅ Sign-up for a free cluster at: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://trymongodb.com/TryAtlasFree</a>\n\n✅ Get help on our Community Forums: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://trymongodb.com/MongoDBCommunity</a>\n\nLearn how to create serverless functions on Azure with C# that communicate to MongoDB Atlas and scale automatically to meet demand.\n\nA written version of this tutorial can be found at → <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://trymongodb.com/3ICEZGT</a>\n\n⏱️ Timestamps ⏱️\n﻿00:00:00 - Intro﻿\n00:00:34 - The Prerequisites\n00:01:07 - Exploring MongoDB Atlas\n00:02:43 - Create a Project with the Azure CLI and Function Core Tools CLI\n00:03:48 - Exploring the Functions Project Locally\n00:04:58 - Installing the MongoDB Driver for C#\n00:06:08 - Mapping MongoDB Documents to C# Objects\n00:09:23 - Establish a Connection to MongoDB\n00:13:31 - Adding MongoDB Logic to the Azure Function\n00:17:06 - Test the Project Locally\n00:18:02 - Deploy the Azure Function with MongoDB to the Cloud\n00:24:30 - Create a Host Key for the Azure Function\n00:26:47 - Making Changes to an Azure Function\n00:30:13 - Outro \n\n—\nSubscribe to MongoDB ➡️ <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://bit.ly/3bpg1Z1</a>","date":"2023-03-02T14:00:22.000Z","type":"Video","tags":[{"name":"*MongoDB","type":"L1Product","slug":"/products/mongodb"},{"name":"*Video","type":"ContentType","slug":"/videos"}],"video_type":"Video","rating_metrics":{"average":null,"median":null,"count":0},"score":{},"slug":"/videos/getting-started-with-azure-functions-and-mongodb-atlas-using-net-and-c-"},{"name":"*Interact with MongoDB Atlas in an AWS Lambda Function Using C#","description":"In this tutorial, we'll see how to create a serverless function using the C# programming language and that function will connect to and query MongoDB Atlas in an efficient manner.","date":"2023-03-01T22:18:00.707Z","image":{"url":"https://mongodb-devhub-cms.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/realm_be9059192c.webp","alternativeText":""},"authors":[{"name":"*Hubert Nguyen","image":{"url":"https://mongodb-devhub-cms.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hubert_nguyen_badget_photo_1100x1100_4a2f9f2ce3.jpg","alternativeText":""}}],"tags":[{"name":"*.Net Framework","type":"Technology","slug":"/technologies/dotnet-framework"},{"name":"*AWS","type":"Technology","slug":"/technologies/aws"},{"name":"*CSharp","type":"ProgrammingLanguage","slug":"/languages/csharp"},{"name":"*Tutorial","type":"ContentType","slug":"/tutorials"},{"name":"*Introductory","type":"ExpertiseLevel","slug":"/expertise-levels/introductory"},{"name":"*MongoDB","type":"L1Product","slug":"/products/mongodb"},{"name":"*MongoDB","type":"AuthorType","slug":"/author-types/mongodb"}],"type":"Tutorial","rating_metrics":{"average":null,"median":null,"count":0},"score":{},"slug":"/languages/csharp/interact-aws-lambda-function-csharp"},{"authors":[],"name":"*Ep. 153 MongoDB University with Eoin Brazil","image":{"url":"https://files.casted.us/911d1b24-d1e4-40be-83b1-648d29143560.png"},"description":"<p>This episode is all about learning, or more specifically, learning on the new relaunched MongoDB University site.

With interactive tutorials and quizzes throughout, developers in the “Learn MongoDB” course can educate themselves on the breadth of MongoDB’s developer data platform and learn best practices for building applications on top of MongoDB. And by completing additional coursework on the programming language of their choice on Codecademy, early-career developers can learn how to code across the full application stack. This is a free, self-paced course that takes approximately eight hours to complete.</p><p><br></p><p>In this episode, Shane McAllister is joined by Melanie Williams &amp; David Patlut from Codecademy to talk more about Codecademy and how this partnership and collaboration came about and what users can expect to learn if they choose to undertake this course.</p><p><br></p><p>Links -&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Learn MongoDB Course - <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-mongodb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-mongodb</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Codecademy Platform - <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/learn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.codecademy.com/learn</a>&nbsp;</p><p>MongoDB University - <a href=\"https://university.mongodb.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://university.mongodb.com/</a> </p>","date":"2022-09-08T21:46:47.178Z","type":"Podcast","tags":[{"name":"*Podcast","type":"ContentType","slug":"/podcasts"}],"rating_metrics":{"average":null,"median":null,"count":0},"score":{},"slug":"/podcasts/ep-127-learn-mongodb-with-codecademy"},{"name":"*Atlas Search Multi-Language Data Modeling","description":"This article will walk through three options of query patterns, data models, and index definitions to support your various multilingual application needs.

We're joined by Kris Jenkins, Developer Advocate from Confluent, and Rob Walters, Product Manager at MongoDB, who will discuss how you can leverage this technology to your benefit and use it in your applications.</p><p><br></p><p>Kafka is traditionally used for building real time streaming data pipelines and real time streaming applications. It began its life in 2010 at LinkedIn and made its way to the public open-source space through a relationship with Apache, the Apache Foundation, in 2011. Since then, the use of Kafka has grown massively and it's estimated that approximately 30% of all Fortune 500 companies are already using Kafka in one way or another. </p><p><br></p><p>A great example for why you might want to use Kafka would be perhaps capturing all of the user activity that happens on your website. As users visit your website, they're interacting with links on the page and scrolling up and down. This is potentially large volumes of data. You may want to store this to understand how users are interacting with your website in real time. Kafka will aid in this process by ingesting and storing all of this activity data while serving up reads for applications on the other side. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Conversation highlights

As mobile contactless experiences become the norm and as businesses move ever-faster to digital platforms and services, edge computing is positioned as a faster, cheaper, and more reliable alternative for data processing and compute at scale.</p> <p class=\"css-1hzcd52 e1top8006\">While mobile devices continue to increase their hardware capabilities with built-in GPUs, custom chipsets, and more storage, even the most cutting-edge devices will suffer the same fundamental problem: each device serves as a single point of failure and, thus, cannot effectively serve as a persistent data storage layer. Said differently, wouldn’t it be nice to have the high-availability of the cloud but with the topological distance to your end users of the smartphone?</p> <p class=\"css-1hzcd52 e1top8006\">Mobile edge computing promises to precisely address this problem—bringing low latency compute to the edge of networks with the high-availability and scale of cloud computing. Through Verizon 5G Edge with AWS Wavelength, we saw the opportunity to explore how to take existing compute-intensive workflows and overlay a data persistence layer with MongoDB, utilizing the MongoDB Atlas management platform, to enable ultra-immersive experiences with personalized experience—reliant on existing database structures in the parent region with the seamlessness to extend to the network edge.</p> <p class=\"css-1hzcd52 e1top8006\">In this episode, we welcome <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertbelson/\">Robbie Belson</a> of Verizon to help us understand this fascinating landscape and its potential.

And the answer is, it depends. This is because document databases have a rich vocabulary that is capable of expressing data relationships in more nuanced ways than SQL. There are many things to consider when picking a schema. Is your app read or write-heavy? What data is frequently accessed together? What are your performance considerations? How will your data set grow and scale?\n\nIn this video, Joe Karlsson will discuss the basics of data modeling using real-world examples. You will learn common methodologies and vocabulary you can use when designing your database schema on your application.\n\nChapters 📑\n0:00 Intro\n0:18 Why is schema design important?\n1:21 Relational vs. MongoDB schema design\n4:16 One to One\n4:41 One to many\n6:10 One to Squillions\n8:02 Many to Many\n8:57 Wrap Up\n\n💬 What topics do you want to see covered next?

MongoDB provides an extremely flexible document model for your use. At the same time the data model you design can seriously speed up or slow down your application. For example, an RDBMS approach to an IoT data storage will significantly slow down the application when used with a document model. This means that with great data modeling flexibility comes even greater responsibility. What are the the best practices for data modeling that leverage MongoDB's flexible Document Model to best support your application through its development? Wonder no more! In this talk we will examine the most important considerations when making decisions about your data model.\n\nTo learn more about MongoDB take our free self-paced MongoDB Basics course! <a href=\"https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M001/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M001/about</a>\n\nSubscribe to MongoDB ►►► <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3bpg1Z1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://bit.ly/3bpg1Z1</a>\n\nConnect with MongoDB:\nWebsite: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2LjtNBZ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://bit.ly/2LjtNBZ</a>\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3fH87gR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://bit.ly/3fH87gR</a>\nFacebook: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3fEaIsd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://bit.ly/3fEaIsd</a>\nLinkedin: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2SY9w90\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://bit.ly/2SY9w90</a>\nInstagram: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3bn9bDv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://bit.ly/3bn9bDv</a>\nTikTok: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3fHoqdJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://bit.ly/3fHoqdJ</a>","date":"2020-10-28T20:35:33.000Z","type":"Video","tags":[{"name":"*MongoDB","type":"L1Product","slug":"/products/mongodb"},{"name":"*Schema","type":"L2Product","slug":"/products/mongodb/schema"},{"name":"*Video","type":"ContentType","slug":"/videos"}],"video_type":"Video","rating_metrics":{"average":null,"median":null,"count":0},"score":{},"slug":"/videos/data-modeling-with-mongodb"},{"authors":[],"name":"*Ep. 24 From Developer to Solutions Architect with Tosin Ajayi","image":{"url":"https://files.casted.us/c3ede62e-f626-422d-aec9-fb2e0cae5f2b.png"},"description":"<p>In this episode we chat with Tosin Ajayi, Solutions Architect Manager at MongoDB to learn about the journey from Developer to Solutions Architect.
