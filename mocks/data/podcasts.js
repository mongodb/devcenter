We're joined by Kris Jenkins, Developer Advocate from Confluent, and Rob Walters, Product Manager at MongoDB, who will discuss how you can leverage this technology to your benefit and use it in your applications.</p><p><br></p><p>Kafka is traditionally used for building real time streaming data pipelines and real time streaming applications. It began its life in 2010 at LinkedIn and made its way to the public open-source space through a relationship with Apache, the Apache Foundation, in 2011. Since then, the use of Kafka has grown massively and it's estimated that approximately 30% of all Fortune 500 companies are already using Kafka in one way or another. </p><p><br></p><p>A great example for why you might want to use Kafka would be perhaps capturing all of the user activity that happens on your website. As users visit your website, they're interacting with links on the page and scrolling up and down. This is potentially large volumes of data. You may want to store this to understand how users are interacting with your website in real time. Kafka will aid in this process by ingesting and storing all of this activity data while serving up reads for applications on the other side. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Conversation highlights include:</strong></p><ul><li>[03:38] What is Kafka?</li><li>[05:29] At the heart of every database</li><li>[08:03] The difference between Kafka and a database</li><li>[09:03] What Kafka's architecture looks like</li><li>[12:03] Kafka as a data backbone of system architecture</li><li>[14:06] MongoDB and Kafka working together</li><li>[15:40] What are \"Topics\" in Kafka?</li><li>[17:53] Chain stream events</li><li>[19:58] Kafka's history</li><li>[22:07] MongoDB Connector, and Kafka via Confluent Cloud</li><li>[25:53] Popular use cases using Kafka and MongoDB</li><li>[27:48] Kafka and stream processing with games and event data</li><li>[29:13] KSQL and processing against the stream of data</li><li>[30:59] Developer.Confluence.io, a place to learn everything about Kafka</li></ul>","mediaType":"podcast","originalPublishDate":"2022-06-24T08:30:00.141Z","title":"*Ep. 115 Exploring Kafka with Kris Jenkins and Rob Walters","podcastFileUrl":"https://media.casted.us/115/rss/promotions/9f599e91.mp3","thumbnailUrl":"https://files.casted.us/6ef7ea19-b280-45d2-8dfe-cfcad5ac5408.png","slug":"/podcasts/ep-115-exploring-kafka-with-kris-jenkins-and-rob-walters","published_at":"2022-12-12T22:51:55.503Z","casted_slug":"9f599e91","l_1_product":{"_id":"624af083ce7cde001ccae945","name":"*MongoDB","published_at":"2022-05-09T18:39:39.595Z","createdAt":"2022-04-04T13:20:03.867Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-19T15:28:14.580Z","__v":0,"calculated_slug":"/products/mongodb","description":"An integrated suite of cloud database services that allows you to address a wide variety of use cases for transactional and analytical workloads.","primary_cta":"https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/","documentation_link":"https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/getting-started/","id":"624af083ce7cde001ccae945"},"tags":[],"products":[],"languages":[],"SEO":null,"related_content":[],"other_tags":null,"id":"6397b08bd1a18fd6febb6f47"},{"authors":[],"technology":[],"programming_language":[],"_id":"6397b08bd1a18fd6febb6f4a","description":"<p>MongoDB Developer Advocate and host of The MongoDB Podcast Michael Lynn discusses best practices for attending your first tech conference.

As mobile contactless experiences become the norm and as businesses move ever-faster to digital platforms and services, edge computing is positioned as a faster, cheaper, and more reliable alternative for data processing and compute at scale.</p> <p class=\"css-1hzcd52 e1top8006\">While mobile devices continue to increase their hardware capabilities with built-in GPUs, custom chipsets, and more storage, even the most cutting-edge devices will suffer the same fundamental problem: each device serves as a single point of failure and, thus, cannot effectively serve as a persistent data storage layer. Said differently, wouldn’t it be nice to have the high-availability of the cloud but with the topological distance to your end users of the smartphone?</p> <p class=\"css-1hzcd52 e1top8006\">Mobile edge computing promises to precisely address this problem—bringing low latency compute to the edge of networks with the high-availability and scale of cloud computing. Through Verizon 5G Edge with AWS Wavelength, we saw the opportunity to explore how to take existing compute-intensive workflows and overlay a data persistence layer with MongoDB, utilizing the MongoDB Atlas management platform, to enable ultra-immersive experiences with personalized experience—reliant on existing database structures in the parent region with the seamlessness to extend to the network edge.</p> <p class=\"css-1hzcd52 e1top8006\">In this episode, we welcome <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertbelson/\">Robbie Belson</a> of Verizon to help us understand this fascinating landscape and its potential.
