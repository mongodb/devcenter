Leveraging her past experience as a Solutions Architect for some of MongoDB’s most demanding customers, Karen loves to trigger that “aha” moment in the minds of developers - when they recognize a better path to simplify, enhance, and accelerate their projects in ways they never thought possible. Prior MongoDB, Karen spent most of her career working with video game developers as a Solutions Architect and Integration Engineer at Nvidia, Amazon and Twitch. In her free time, Karen embarrasses her 2 kids, spoils her dog, and feeds her addiction to adventure travel - not necessarily in that order.","name":"*Karen Huaulme","title":"*Principal Developer Advocate","published_at":"2021-11-18T18:28:29.305Z","createdAt":"2021-11-18T18:28:29.308Z","updatedAt":"2022-05-06T17:38:31.246Z","__v":0,"image":{"_id":"61969b4ca0957d40b0be64e2","name":"*bio-karen.jpg","hash":"bio_karen_e653fae27d","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":97.2,"width":1092,"height":1092,"url":"https://mongodb-devhub-cms.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/bio_karen_e653fae27d.jpg","formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"*thumbnail_bio-karen.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_bio_karen_e653fae27d","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":156,"height":156,"size":5.38,"path":null,"url":"https://mongodb-devhub-cms.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_bio_karen_e653fae27d.jpg"},"large":{"name":"*large_bio-karen.jpg","hash":"large_bio_karen_e653fae27d","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"height":1000,"size":101.56,"path":null,"url":"https://mongodb-devhub-cms.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/large_bio_karen_e653fae27d.jpg"},"medium":{"name":"*medium_bio-karen.jpg","hash":"medium_bio_karen_e653fae27d","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":750,"height":750,"size":64.87,"path":null,"url":"https://mongodb-devhub-cms.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/medium_bio_karen_e653fae27d.jpg"},"small":{"name":"*small_bio-karen.jpg","hash":"small_bio_karen_e653fae27d","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":500,"size":33.01,"path":null,"url":"https://mongodb-devhub-cms.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/small_bio_karen_e653fae27d.jpg"}},"provider":"aws-s3","related":["61969b4da0957d40b0be64e3"],"createdAt":"2021-11-18T18:28:28.797Z","updatedAt":"2021-11-18T18:28:29.509Z","__v":0,"id":"61969b4ca0957d40b0be64e2"},"calculated_slug":"/author/karen-huaulme","twitter":"https://twitter.com/YouOldMaid","updated_by":"60958855b4522964e193dbc8","id":"61969b4da0957d40b0be64e3"}],"_id":"63dc33f66061ee001d05dc97","registration_url":"https://www.devoxx.co.uk/","start_time":"2023-05-10T17:00:00.000Z","slug":"/devoxx-uk-23","end_time":"2023-05-12T17:00:00.000Z","title":"*Devoxx UK 2023","content":"Meet with our team atj devoxx uk\n\n## Sessions by MongoDB\n\n| Date | Session Title | Speaker |\n|---|---|---|\nMay 10| [Deep-dive: Game Changer!
