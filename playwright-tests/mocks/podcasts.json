Hosted on <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/learn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the Codecademy platform</a>, the course teaches students the basics of MongoDB and how to perform CRUD operations, query and analyze data, and create and use indexes. With interactive tutorials and quizzes throughout, developers in the “Learn MongoDB” course can educate themselves on the breadth of MongoDB’s developer data platform and learn best practices for building applications on top of MongoDB. And by completing additional coursework on the programming language of their choice on Codecademy, early-career developers can learn how to code across the full application stack. This is a free, self-paced course that takes approximately eight hours to complete.</p><p><br></p><p>In this episode, Shane McAllister is joined by Melanie Williams &amp; David Patlut from Codecademy to talk more about Codecademy and how this partnership and collaboration came about and what users can expect to learn if they choose to undertake this course.</p><p><br></p><p>Links -&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Learn MongoDB Course - <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-mongodb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-mongodb</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Codecademy Platform - <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/learn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.codecademy.com/learn</a>&nbsp;</p><p>MongoDB University - <a href=\"https://university.mongodb.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://university.mongodb.com/</a> </p>",
